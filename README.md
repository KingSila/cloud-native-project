# Cloud Native Learning Project

## Overview
This project is a **12-week structured journey** into building strong foundations and practical skills in **Cloud Native technologies**. It combines theory, hands-on practice, and daily reflections to track key learnings.

The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the tools, practices, and principles that power modern cloud infrastructure and DevOps workflows.

---

## Topics Covered
The program is divided into thematic areas to cover essential skills:

- **Linux & Shell Scripting**
- **Networking Fundamentals & Troubleshooting**
- **Python for Automation**
- **Ansible** (Configuration Management)
- **Core Cloud Services** (Compute, Storage, Networking, IAM, etc.)
- **Cloud Networking**
- **Cloud Economics** (cost models & optimization)
- **Containers** (Docker fundamentals)
- **Kubernetes** (orchestration & scaling)
- **CI/CD Fundamentals**
- **Pipeline Tools** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**
- **Monitoring & Observability** (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, etc.)
- **Cloud Security** (principles, practices, and tools)

---

## Structure
- **Duration:** 12 Weeks
- **Format:** Each week focuses on a set of core topics and practical exercises.
- **Daily Log:**
  - A journal-style log is maintained to document key learnings, challenges, and progress.
  - This creates a reference guide and reflection tool to reinforce learning.

---

## Goals
- Build hands-on familiarity with **cloud-native tools and practices**.
- Develop a **DevOps mindset** by combining automation, scalability, and continuous delivery.
- Understand the **economics and trade-offs** of cloud adoption.
- Learn to design, deploy, secure, and monitor workloads in cloud environments.
- Create a **portfolio of scripts, playbooks, IaC templates, and pipelines** by the end of 12 weeks.

---

## How to Use This Repository
- **/logs** → Daily logs of key learnings.
- **/scripts** → Linux, Python, and automation scripts.
- **/ansible** → Ansible playbooks.
